This repository contains all of the information that we utilizied during our Capstone Project (23-24):
Autonomous Course Assistant using NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano

The capstone project focuses on implementing a facial recognition system using the NVIDIA Jetson Nano embedded computing board. The primary objective is to address the challenges in attendance recording within academic settings, emphasizing efficiency and accuracy, specifically for recording attendance and verifying student participation. The project encompasses various phases, starting from the initial setup and software installation to the development of a functional prototype.

Traditional attendance recording methods are labor-intensive and error-prone, necessitating a more efficient and secure solution. The opportunity lies in leveraging advanced technologies, specifically facial recognition, to automate attendance recording and streamline classroom management.

In this repository you will find all documentation and links to help us complete this task.
